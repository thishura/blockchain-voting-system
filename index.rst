Introduction
============

This document is aimed at authors of and contributors to documentation for projects under the Pylons Project.
This document describes style and reStructuredText syntax used in project documentation.
We provide examples, including reStructuredText code and its rendered output, for both visual and technical reference.

The source code of this guide is located in its `project repository on GitHub <https://github.com/Pylons/docs-style-guide>`_.

For Python coding style guidelines, see `Coding Style <https://pylonsproject.org/community-coding-style-standards.html#coding-style>`_.

We have adopted the convention from :RFC:`2119` for key words.

    The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in :RFC:`2119`.

Other conventions throughout this guide are adopted and adapted from `Documenting Python <https://devguide.python.org/documenting/>`_, `Plone Documentation Style Guide <https://docs.plone.org/about/contributing/documentation_styleguide.html>`_, and `Write The Docs <http://www.writethedocs.org/>`_.
